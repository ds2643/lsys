# lsys

Component of browser-embedded interpreter coauthored with **Tara Vancil**.

**This software is currently under active development. Contributions and suggestions are welcome, but the software does not yet satisfy its specification in its current form. Please revisit for updates regarding progression towards an alpha state.**
